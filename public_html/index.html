                    <p id='text'>Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flower.
                        My Mom's name is Rosa which means rose. In temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in glasshouses and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover so that the flowers do not get damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively.
                        Most of the roses are grown in some tropical countries and these are shipped by air to markets across the world </p>
